# Problem Statement

# Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() function for you 
# which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

# Solution :

def double(num: int):
    return num * 2

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    num_times_2 = double(num)
    print("Double that is", num_times_2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
